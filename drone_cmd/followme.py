followme - Tracks GPS position of your computer (Linux only).

This example uses the python gps package to read positions from a GPS attached to your
laptop and sends a new vehicle.simple_goto command every two seconds to move the
vehicle to the current point.

When you want to stop follow-me, either change vehicle modes or type Ctrl+C to exit the script.

Example documentation: http://python.dronekit.io/examples/follow_me.html
