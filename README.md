# Banana Drone Delivery
A Project that uses an autonomus vehicle for delivering Bananas directly to it's clients. We developed the prototype using a rasberry pi/pixhawk driven RC car and an android client app. A client can order bananas right on it's smartphone, which are directly delivery by our RC drone using the client's location.
