# Banana Drone Delivery
A Project that uses an autonomus vehicle for delivering Bananas directly to it's clients. We developed the prototype using a rasberry pi/pixhawk driven RC car and an android client app. A client can order bananas right on it's smartphone, which are directly delivery by our RC drone using the client's location. Before receiving the goods, the client has to show the generated QR code for the given order.
